## ✨ Vision

This repo is my **battle diary**: each commit is a tangible step toward mastery in programming and software design. I honor the traditional craft — learn, fail, refactor — yet I’m never afraid to break rules when logic demands.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Browse

1. **Start with the index** in each folder — there’s usually a local `README.md` outlining that topic’s goals.  
2. **Read the commits** – messages are concise but intentional, documenting thought process and experiments.  
3. **Run the code** by opening the files directly or running the scripts/programs with your usual tools or IDE.
If you find bugs or issues, open an issue here in the repo — discovering a bug is half the battle.

## 🤝 Contributing

This repo is **my dojo** — sparring partners welcome. If something looks rough, open a PR. Ground rules:

1. Keep commit style (`<scope>: <imperative message>`).  
2. No giant dependencies “just because.”  
3. Clean code, surgical comments.
